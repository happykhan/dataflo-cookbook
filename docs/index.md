# Welcome to The Data-flo Cookbook

This 'cookbook' has a collection of examples or 'recipes' to show you how to make the most of [Data-flo](https://next.data-flo.io/). [Data-flo](https://next.data-flo.io/) (pronounced data-flow) is an open-source web application for data integration. It provides an easy-to-use visual interface to design reusable Workflows (data pipelines) that import, merge, clean, and manipulate data in many different ways. Once a Workflow has been created, it can be run anytime, by anyone with access, to enable push-button data extraction and transformation.
